This Python script simulates a simplified 2D model of the solar system using Newtonian gravity. It visualizes the motion of celestial bodies (like the Sun, Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury) using `matplotlib.animation`.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates gravitational interaction between multiple bodies
- Uses Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
- Visualizes orbits and motion with real-time animation
- Editable body parameters (mass, position, velocity, etc.)
- Easy to extend with new planets or celestial objects
